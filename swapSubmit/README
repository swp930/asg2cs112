This program was completed using pair programming.
 * Swapnil Patil (swdpatil@ucsc.edu)
 * Michael Lanthier (malanthi@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair
should drive roughtly fifty percent of the time the pair
is working together, and at most twenty five percent of 
an individual's effort for an assignment should be spent
working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must
be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work together,
learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece. 

  Swapnil Patil spent		4 hours working alone
  Michael Lanthier spent	5 hours working alone
  We spent 			14 hours together
  Swapnil Patil spent		7 hours driving
  Michael Lanthier spent	7 hours driving
